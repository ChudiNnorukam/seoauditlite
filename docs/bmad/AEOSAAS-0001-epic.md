AEOSAAS-0001 — SEOAuditLite Micro SaaS Epic

Objective

Build a production-ready, subscription-based micro SaaS that audits AI Search / AEO readiness of websites, delivers immediate value without signup, and is explicitly designed for affiliate distribution and marketplace approval (AppSumo, Rewardful, etc.).

The product must be:

Instantly demoable

Ethically upsold

Affiliate-safe

Technically simple but commercially sharp

Product Thesis

AI-driven search (LLMs, answer engines) is now a first-class discovery channel. Most websites are invisible to these systems.

SEOAuditLite answers one question clearly:

"Can AI systems understand and surface your site — and what should you fix next?"

Core Principles

1. Value Before Friction

First audit requires no signup

Results appear in under 2 minutes

Auth and billing only after value is proven

2. Vertical Slice Development

Work proceeds in end-to-end slices, never horizontal layers.

Each slice must be:

Production-safe

Demoable

Affiliate-promotable

3. Contract-First

The Audit Result JSON Schema is the canonical contract.
No Slice 1 code is written before schema approval.

4. Affiliate-First by Design

Affiliate tracking, shareable links, and clean attribution are core product features, not marketing add-ons.
